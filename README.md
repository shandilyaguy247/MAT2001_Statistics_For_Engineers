# MAT2001_Statistics_For_Engineers

## Prerequisites 

You will need to have R Studio installed on your machine. 

## Usage

There are a total of 10 lab tasks. The first one is a basic introduction and is hence excluded from this repository. 
The R codes for the remaining 9 tasks are included in the folder 'Lab Tasks'. 
Professors only accept console output not .rmd files. Hence, you can copy the lines of code from the files and paste it in the R Console.
I have also included the source files for the codes in the folder 'PDF Material'.  

## Contributing
Pull requests and any corrections to the codes are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
